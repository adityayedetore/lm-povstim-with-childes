# CHILDES Processing

The training data, `pretraining/` and `finetuning/`, can be downloaded from [here](http://www.adityayedetore.com/childes-project/) as ziped directories.

Alternatively, to extract the training data from `childes-xml` and `childes-treebank`, first download `childes-xml.zip` and `childes-treebank.zip` from the link above, unzip the files and place them in this directory, and then run `python main.py`. This code should take 10-20 minutes to run.

The xml and treebank corpora were downloaded from the [childes website](https://childes.talkbank.org/data-xml/Eng-NA/).
